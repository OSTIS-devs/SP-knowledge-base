# ISA-88 knowledge base

Knowledge base of [ISA-88 standard](http://www.isa-88.com/) powered by [OSTIS technology](https://github.com/ostis-dev).  

## General information

The purpose of this project is to **build an ontological model of batch manufactoring enterprise to improve industrial control quality of such enterprises and their ability to adapt to a constantly changing environment**.

Improvements of the industrial control level assumes a significant increase in the number of automatic or automated tasks. **This, in turn, calls for automated solutions to intellectual problems, i.e. the use of artificial intelligence technologies**.

Intelletual problems to be solved in the enterprise include:
* analysis of manufactoring situation (including emergencies);
* decision-making at different levels;
* planning behaviour in difficult circumstances;
* creating and maintaining documentation;
* training new and current employees;
* etc.
